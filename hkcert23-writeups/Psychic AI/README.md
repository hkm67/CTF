This challenge hid its flag behind a ChatGPT bot. All we had to do is just to activate its "DAN" mode ("Do Anything Now"), or also known as jailbreak mode", by feeding it the related prompts - they are all over the internet. Afterwards, the flag was revealed simply by asking the AI bot to give us the flag.
